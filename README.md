# EGS-Global-Kata
EGS Global Technical Test

## About
This is the solution to the technical test presented for the interview process at EGS Global.

## Dependencies
This project doesn't contain any dependencies other than JUnit 5, which was configured directly using Eclipse. In other circumstances, I would have chosen to configure a Maven or Gradle build system as it is more professional.

## Running locally
No parameters are necessary to run this program.

The main method add() is in the class KataMain

## Technical resources
IDE: Eclipse version 2022-12 (4.26.0) Java 19 JUnit 5

## Owner
Pablo Tejero
